#+TITLE: Ideas for posts

* org-mode for daily logging
Daily "what I did" + org-capture

* org-mode for notes - need some research for this
It would be cool to talk about how to grow a series of notes for a
project. Something like a Zettelkasten, but with a starting procedure
better structured for org-mode.
