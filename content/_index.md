My name is Aaron Lee and I am a software engineer. Most recently I've
focused on Site Reliability Engineering, but I've worked on all
aspects of web applications at some point in my career. Previously
I've worked on robotic systems that were structured like web
applications, as well as digital signage that was structured like a
web application.
